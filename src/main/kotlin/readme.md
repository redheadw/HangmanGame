I read that Kotlin was allowed me to expand on what Java could do and I wanted to try it out with a simple App

I wrote a hangman app that only does six letter words

I wanted to see if I could write an app

# Development Environment

Kotlin was developed by google to work with Java to develop Android Apps. I used VS code which I do not recommend. IntellJ Idea was recommended, which I will next time.

# Future Work

I need to make sure my Java and Kotlin versions can talk to each other.
I need to understand what has to happen to create a working enviroment.
I need to give up doing anything for pleasure because I just don't have time for it.
